# Introduction

In this project, we will be exploring 4 types of regression models that strengthen model interpretability and prediction accuracy. Two of the regression models, ridge regression and lasso regression, are shrinkage methods which constrains the coefficient estimates to shrink the coefficient estimates towards zero. This helps reduce coefficient estimates reduce their variance. The other two regression methods, principal components analysis and partial least squares, are dimension reduction methods. Dimension reduction methods essentially reduce the number of predictors under consideration to strengthen a model. We will be applying these methods to the Credit Dataset to create various models predicting a person's Balance from various independent variables. We will discuss my methods in R, my various results, and conclusions about the relationships and statistics I find.
