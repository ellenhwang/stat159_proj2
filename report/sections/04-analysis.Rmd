## Lasso Regression

When we perform cross validation and compute the associated test error we find that the MSE is qite low at `r lasso.mse`. There are also quite a few coefficients that are zero. 

```{r}
lasso.coef
```

So all in all, we find that exactly 7 predictors are relevant in the regression. 

```{r}
lasso.coef.official
```


## Partial Least Squares Regression

Looking at the pls output summary, we see that the cross-validation error occurs when M = `r pls.best.mod.value` are used. The corresponding test set MSE = `r pls.mse`. Finally, we perform PLS using the full data set using M = `r pls.best.mod.value` which is the number found in cross-validation. Looking at the summary of this model:

```{r}
summary(pls.fit.full)
```

We see that the `r pls.best.mod.value` component PLS fit explains 86.63% of the variance.
