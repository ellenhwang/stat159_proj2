# Data

For this model, we use the Credit.csv dataset available from the Introduction to Statistical Learning website [(download)](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL). This dataset is analyzed in Chapter 6 of the ISL book.

This dataset contains "Balance", representing average credit card debt across a group of people, and 10 explanatory variables, of which 6 are quantitative and 4 categorical. The quantitative variables are: Income, Credit Limit, Credit Rating, No. of Cards, Age and Years of Education. The categorical variables are: Gender, Student Status, Marital Status and Ethnicity.

We include basic exploratory data analysis below:
