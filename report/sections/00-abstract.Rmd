# Abstract

This report will be examining the applications of ridge regression (RR), lasso regression (LR), principal components regression (PCR), and partial least squares regression (PLSR). We will also be exploring how cross validation methods apply to each of these models and how cross validation strengthens our models. Our project will be using the Credit dataset, taken from the webpage for the text, *An Introduction to Statistical Learning*, to perform this simple linear regression. This report will include a description of the data, methods, analysis, and results for the regression models created.
