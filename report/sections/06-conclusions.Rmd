Throughout this project, we have used a variety of linear models to predict credit card Balance based on owner data. We began by cleaning and preprocessing the data, and then performed a variety of different regression techniques on both the quantitative and (one-hot encoded) qualitative factors.

We found that the best predictors of credit card debt were not demographic but individual - factors such as income, credit rating, and student status. Demographic factors tended to be less predictive, and were indeed ignored by our final model.

From our data, it is clear that shrinkage methods such as Lasso and Ridge are most effective at modeling this dataset, with Lasso in particular performing well.
