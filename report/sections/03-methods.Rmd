## Preprocessing

We use one-hot encoding to dummy out categorical variables, and perform mean-centering and standardization of all variables, setting their means to 0 and standard deviations to 1 to give us comparable scales.

We then split the data into a training set (75\% of total data) and a testing set (25\% of total data) for the purposes of tuning hyperparameters (such as $\lambda$ in lasso and ridge regressions).

## Lasso Regression

With lasso regression, we first create a preliminary model using `glmnet()` on the training dataset, with $\alpha=1$ to represent the elasticnet mixing penalty used in lasso regression. We then cross validate our model on our training set using the function `cv.glmnet()`. During cross-validation, we perform a parameter search for lambda in the range $(10^{-10}, 10^{10})$, which was an expansion on the given grid from the project spec. Lastly, we fit a model to the full dataset and predict credit card balances using our best lambda found via CV.

## Partial Least Squares Regression

With PLS regression, we use the  `plsr()` function modeling *Balance* as a function of all other variables. To find the best number of components, we perform cross-validation and find the minimum of the validation PRESS features. Ultimately, we perform plsr regression on the full dataset using the best number of components found via cross-validation.

## Ridge Regression

As with lasso regression, we create an initial model using `glmnet()` on the training dataset, with $\alpha=0$ to represent the elasticnet mixing penalty used in ridge regression. We then cross validate our model on our training set using the function `cv.glmnet()`. Once again, we perform a parameter search for lambda using the extended grid $(10^{-10}, 10^{10})$. Finally, we fit a model to the full dataset and predict credit card balances using our best lambda found via CV.

## Principal Components Regression

Similar to with PLS regression, in PCR we `pcr()` function from the `pls` package to implement our regression. Again, we perform 10-fold cross-validation to determine the optimal number of components, and then make predictions of the full dataset based on that number of components.
